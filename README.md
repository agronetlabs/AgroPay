# AgroNet & AgroCrypto — Cognitive Infrastructure for ESG Finance and Agricultural Sovereignty 🌱🧠

AgroNet and AgroCrypto form a supranational infrastructure for tokenizing agricultural assets, carbon credits, and ESG metrics — powered natively by Artificial Intelligence.

> "AI is not a feature. It is the operational brainstem of the AgroNet ecosystem."

## 🧠 Neural Architecture: The Role of AI

Artificial Intelligence is the cognitive core of the ecosystem. It governs validation, compliance, asset scoring, policy enforcement, and autonomous adaptation — across three layers:

- **Local (Ryzen AI):** On-device inferencing
- **Edge (NVIDIA 6G):** Distributed neural processing at AgroNet nodes
- **Cloud (Google TPUs):** Global-scale AI model execution and ESG analytics

---

## 🔐 AgroCrypto Trust Framework (ATF)

AI-driven certification engine for tokenized assets:
- ESG scoring
- Carbon credit verification
- Commodity token audit
- Regulatory compliance automation

Tokens are alive, self-aware, and institutionally admissible.

---

## 🔄 Self-Governance via Neural Autonomy

AgroNet consumes real-time agricultural, environmental, and transactional data:
- Adapts operational policies automatically
- Validates smart contracts dynamically
- Releases credit and adjusts limits based on impact

Result: A living ecosystem that learns, corrects, and scales autonomously.
